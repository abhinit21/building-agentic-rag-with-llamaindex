# Building Agentic Rag with LlamaIndex

This repository contains the code for building an Agentic Rag (a type of language model) using the LlamaIndex library. The project utilizes various components, including Python files, asset directories, and a virtual environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new virtual environment using your preferred tool (e.g., `python -m venv venv` for Python's built-in `venv` module).
3. Activate the virtual environment (e.g., `source venv/bin/activate` on Unix-based systems or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows).
4. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Set up the necessary environment variables (if applicable) in the `.env` file.
6. Open the `RouterQueryEngine.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions provided to build and interact with the Agentic Rag model.
